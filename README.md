This project started as an interesting insurance data set found publically available on Kaggle. 
After cleaning the data to focus on Business Owner Policies "BOP", XGBoost was used to predict loss ratios. 
Results were poor but directionally accurate so tried playing around with SHAP to get a sense of explainability. 
Finally used the predicted values and some geographical constraints to implement an LP model via Gurobi. 
Showed potential for an up to 25% increase in profitability!
